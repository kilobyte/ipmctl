ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
  Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

PROPERTIES
----------
CLI_DEFAULT_DIMM_ID::
  The default display of DCPMM identifiers. One of:
  - "UID": Use the DimmUID attribute as defined in the section
  *_Show Device_*.
  - "HANDLE": Use the DimmHandle attribute as defined in section
    *_Show Device_*. This is the default

CLI_DEFAULT_SIZE::
  The default display of capacities in the CLI. One of:
  - "AUTO": Automatically choose the best format for each capacity in binary
    multiples of bytes (i.e., B, MiB, GiB or TiB). This is the default.
  - "AUTO_10": Automatically choose the best format for each capacity in decimal
    multiples of bytes (i.e., B, MB, GB or TB).
  - "B": Displays all capacities in bytes.
  - "MB": Displays all capacities in megabytes.
  - "MiB": Displays all capacities in mebibytes.
  - "GB": Displays all capacities in gigabytes.
  - "GiB": Displays all capacities in gibibytes.
  - "TB": Displays all capacities in terabytes.
  - "TiB": Displays all capacities in tebibytes.

APPDIRECT_SETTINGS::
  The interleave settings to use when creating App Direct capacity in the
  format: [underline]#(IMCSize_ChannelSize)#. Must be one of the BIOS supported
  App Direct settings returned by the command *_Show System Capabilities_*.

NOTE: ByOne is not a valid setting for this preference. The default is
"RECOMMENDED" which uses the BIOS recommended App Direct settings.

NOTE: The same interleave settings are used for all the App Direct capacity in
the system. Therefore, if any App Direct capacity already exists, this
preference cannot be changed.

APPDIRECT_GRANULARITY::
  The minimum App Direct granularity per DCPMM supported by the command
  *_Create Memory Allocation Goal_*. One of:
  - "RECOMMENDED": Use the recommended App Direct granularity of 32 GiB.
  - "1": Allows 1 GiB App Direct granularity which may result in App Direct region
       sizes that are not recommended.

ifdef::os_build[]
PERFORMANCE_MONITOR_ENABLED::
  Whether or not the monitor is periodically storing performance metrics for the
  DCPMMs in the host server. One of:
  - "0": Disable performance monitoring.
  - "1": Enable performance monitoring. This is the default.

PERFORMANCE_MONITOR_INTERVAL_MINUTES::
  The interval in minutes that the monitor is storing performance metrics (if
  enabled). The default value is 180 minutes and must be >= 1.

EVENT_MONITOR_ENABLED::
  Whether or not the monitor is periodically checking for DCPMM events.
  - "0": Disable event monitoring.
  - "1": Enable event monitoring. This is the default.

EVENT_MONITOR_INTERVAL_MINUTES::
  The interval in minutes that the monitor is checking for DCPMM events (if
  enabled). The default value is 1 minutes and must be >= 1.

EVENT_LOG_MAX::
  The maximum number of events to keep in the management software. The default
  value is 0 (no limit). The valid range is [underline]#0 - 2,147,483,647#.

DBG_LOG_MAX::
  The maximum number of debug log entries to keep in the management software.
  The default value is 0 (no limit). The valid range is
  [underline]#0 - 2,147,483,647#.

DBG_LOG_LEVEL::
  Whether debug logging is enabled in the DCPMM host software. These logs
  pertain to the operation of the command-line tool only and do not reflect any
  logging functionality of the DCPMM. One of:
  - "0": Logging is disabled. This is the default.
  - "1": Log Errors.
  - "2": Log Warnings, Errors.
  - "3": Log Informational, Warnings, Errors.
  - "4": Log Verbose, Informational, Warnings, Errors.

EXAMPLES
--------
Use DimmUID as the default DCPMM identifier, and display all capacities in bytes.

RETURN DATA
-----------
Returns the status of the operation.
