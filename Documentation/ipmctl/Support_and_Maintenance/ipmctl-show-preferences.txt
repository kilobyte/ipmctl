  - HANDLE: Use the DimmHandle attribute as defined in the command Show Device.
    This is the default.

CLI_DEFAULT_SIZE::
  The default display of capacities in the CLI. One of:
  - AUTO: Automatically choose the best format for each capacity in binary
    multiples of bytes (i.e., B, MiB, GiB or TiB). This is the default.

  - B: Displays all capacities in bytes.
  - MB: Displays all capacities in megabytes.
  - MiB: Displays all capacities in mebibytes.
  - GB: Displays all capacities in gigabytes.
  - GiB: Displays all capacities in gibibytes.
  - TB: Displays all capacities in terabytes.
  - TiB: Displays all capacities in tebibytes.

  - 1: Allows 1 GiB App Direct granularity which may result in App Direct region
    sizes that are not recommended.

DBG_LOG_LEVEL::
  Whether debug logging is enabled in the DCPMM host software. These logs
