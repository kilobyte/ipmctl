NAME
----
ipmctl-dump-support-data - Dumps a support snapshot to a file

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl dump [OPTIONS] -destination (file_prefix) [-dict (filename)] -support

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Creates a support snapshot and dump support data to a file for off-line analysis
by support personnel. Support data may include system log(s), error log(s),
trace log(s), platform configuration, sensor information and diagnostic results.

This command may take significantly longer than other commands to complete, because
it combines and executes multiple individual commands.

Commands executed:

* version
* show -memoryresources
* show -a -system -capabilities
* show -a -topology
* start -diagnostic
* show -system

Commands executed per DCPMM:

* show -a -dimm
* show -a -sensor -dimm
* show -pcd -dimm
* show -error media -dimm
* show -error thermal -dimm

OPTIONS
-------
-h::
-help::
    Displays help for the command.

-ddrt::
  Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-smbus::
  Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::

endif::os_build[]

TARGET
------
-destination (filename)::
  This command creates a text file with a name starting with the given
  filename option and dumps the platform support information into it.
  In addition, this command also outputs the debug log information in
  separate files. Refer to *_Dump Debug Log_* for more details.

-dict (filename)::
  Optional file path to the dictionary file. If supplied, the command will
  create both the binary debug log and a text file with decoded log data with
  the file prefix specified by -destination. This option is used only to dump
  the debug log information.

EXAMPLES
--------
Creates a text file named dumpfile_platform_support_info.txt and stores the
platform supported data in that file. Also, dumps the debug log info in the
related files that start with the file name dumpfile_*. Refer to
*_Dump Debug Log_* for more info on the output files.
