=======================
endif::manpage[]

NAME
----
ipmctl-modify-device - Changes the configurable setting(s) on one or more DCPMMs

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl set [OPTIONS] -dimm (DimmIDs) AveragePowerReportingTimeConstant=(100-12000)

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Changes the configurable setting(s) on one or more DCPMMs.

OPTIONS
-------
-f::
-force::
  Changing DCPMM setting(s) is a potentially destructive operation which
  requires confirmation from the user for each DCPMM. This option suppresses the
  confirmation.

-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
  Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

TARGETS
-------
-dimm (DimmIDs)::
  Modifies specific DCPMMs by supplying one or more comma-separated DCPMM
  identifiers. However, this is not recommended as it may put the system in an
  undesirable state. The default is to modify all manageable DCPMMs.

PROPERTIES
----------
AveragePowerReportingTimeConstantMultiplier::
  The value that is used to multiply the base time value used for average power
  consumption measurements. Can be set to a value between 0 and 32. The default
  value is 0.

AveragePowerReportingTimeConstant::
  The value, in milliseconds, used to determine the time constant for reporting
  the average power consumption measurements. Can be set to a value between 100
  and 12000, by increments of 100. The default value is 1000.

EXAMPLES
--------
Sets average power reporting time constant multiplier to 1 on all manageable DCPMMs
[verse]
set -dimm AveragePowerReportingTimeConstant=1500

LIMITATIONS
-----------
In order to successfully execute this command:

- The caller must have the appropriate privileges.

- The specified DCPMM(s) must be manageable by the host software.

RETURN DATA
-----------
For each DCPMM, the CLI will indicate the status of the operation. If a failure
occurs when modifying multiple DCPMMs, the process will exit and not continue
modifying the remaining DCPMMs.

SAMPLE OUTPUT
-------------
[verse]
Modify DIMM (DimmID): Success
Modify DIMM (DimmID): Error (Code)-(Description)
