===========================
endif::manpage[]

NAME
----
ifndef::os_build[]
ipmctl-erase-device-data - Erases the persistent data on one or more DCPMMs
endif::os_build[]
ifdef::os_build[]
ipmctl-erase-device-data - Erases the persistent data on one or more DCPMMs on supported OS
endif::os_build[]

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl delete [OPTIONS] -dimm [TARGETS] Passphrase=(string)

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Erases the persistent data on one or more DCPMMs.

ifdef::os_build[]
NOTE: This command is subject to OS Vendor (OSV) support. It will return "Not Supported."
endif::os_build[]

OPTIONS
-------
-f::
-force::
  Erasing DCPMM data is a destructive operation which requires confirmation from
  the user for each DCPMM. This option suppresses the confirmation.

-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
  Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

-source (path)::
  File path to a local file containing the new passphrase (1-32 characters).

TARGETS
-------
-dimm (DimmIDs)::
Erases specific specifics by supplying one or more comma-separated specific
identifiers. However, this is not recommended as it may put the system in an
undesirable state. The default is to erase all manageable DCPMMs.

PROPERTIES
----------
Passphrase::
  If security state is disabled, then passphrase is not required and will be ignored
  if supplied. +
  If security state is enabled, then a passphrase must be supplied. +
  The current passphrase (1-32 characters). For better passphrase protection, specify
  an empty string (e.g., Passphrase="") to be prompted for the passphrase or to use a
  file containing the passphrase with the source option.

EXAMPLES
--------
Security disabled DCPMMs: Erases all the persistent data on all DCPMMs in the
system.
[verse]
ipmctl delete -dimm

Security enabled specifics: Erases all the persistent data on all DCPMMs in the
system.
[verse]
ipmctl delete -dimm Passphrase=123

Erases all the persistent data on all DCPMMs by having the CLI prompt for
the current passphrase.
[verse]
ipmctl delete -dimm Passphrase=""

LIMITATIONS
-----------
To successfully execute this command, the caller must have the appropriate privileges
and the specified DCPMM(s) must be manageable by the host software, not be
in the "Unlocked, Frozen", "Disabled, Frozen", or "Exceeded" lock states and any
namespaces associated with the requested DCPMM(s) must be deleted before running this 
command.

ifdef::os_build[]
The command is subject to OS Vendor (OSV) support. If OSV does not provide
support, the command will return "Not Supported."
endif::os_build[]

RETURN DATA
-----------
If an empty string is provided for the passphrase property and the source option is not
included, the user will be prompted (once for all DCPMMs) to enter the current
passphrase. The passphrase characters are hidden.

Current passphrase: ****

For each DCPMM, the CLI will indicate the status of the security state change.
If a failure occurs when changing multiple DCPMMs, the process will exit and
not continue updating the remaining DCPMMs.

SAMPLE OUTPUT
-------------
[verse]
Erase DIMM (DimmID): Success
Erase DIMM (DimmID): Error (Code) - (Description)
