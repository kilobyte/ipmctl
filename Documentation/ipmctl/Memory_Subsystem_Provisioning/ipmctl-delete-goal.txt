=====================

NAME
----
ipmctl-delete-goal - Deletes the memory allocation goal from PMem modules

SYNOPSIS
--------
[listing]
ipmctl delete [OPTIONS] -goal [TARGETS]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Deletes the memory allocation goal from one or more PMem modules. This command only
deletes a memory allocation goal request that has not yet been processed by
platform firmware (BIOS).

If the PMem module target is used and the specified PMem modules do not include all PMem modules
that are part of a memory allocation goal request the result will be PMem modules
(those not included) that have a broken request which will be rejected by
platform firmware (BIOS) upon the next reboot.

OPTIONS
-------
-h::
-help::
    Displays help for the command.

-ddrt::
  Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-smbus::
  Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

-lpmb::
  Used to specify large transport payload size for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-spmb::
  Used to specify small transport payload size for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -lpmb and -spmb options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
  Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

TARGETS
-------
-dimm [DimmIDs]::
  Deletes the memory allocation goal from specific PMem modules by optionally supplying one or
  more comma-separated PMem module identifiers. The default is to delete the memory
  allocation goals from all manageable PMem modules.

-socket [SocketIds]::
  Deletes the memory allocation goal from the PMem modules on specific sockets by
  supplying the socket target and one or more comma-separated socket
  identifiers. The default is to delete the memory allocation goals from
  manageable PMem modules on all sockets.

EXAMPLES
--------
Deletes the memory allocation goal from all PMem modules on all sockets.
[listing]
ipmctl delete -goal

LIMITATIONS
-----------
In order to successfully execute this command:

- The caller must have the appropriate privileges.

- The specified PMem modules must be manageable by the host software and unlocked if
  security is enabled.

- Given socket and all specified PMem modules must contain a memory allocation goal.

RETURN DATA
-----------
For each PMem module, the CLI will indicate the status of the operation. If a failure occurs
when deleting the memory allocation goals from multiple PMem modules, the process will
output a failure message for those PMem modules that did not succeed and a success
message for those that did.

SAMPLE OUTPUT
-------------
[listing]
Delete memory allocation goal from PMem module (DimmID): Success

[listing]
Delete memory allocation goal from PMem module (DimmID): Error (Code) - (Description)
